** Analysis of sleep deprivation time series

Welcome to scripts linking sleep deprivation analysis: https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/11/26/1910590116.short?rss=1

This was the initial repository for scripts, which is useful for running model selection.

We have now expanded the code into an R package, please visit the [new repository](https://github.com/jakeyeung/SleepDepAnalysis) for detailed explanation of how to explore and model the time series data.
